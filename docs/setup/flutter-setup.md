## üì• Installing Flutter

1. Download the SDK from the [official site](https://docs.flutter.dev/get-started/install).

2. Extract it to a folder (for example):
   * Windows: `C:\src\flutter`
   * macOS/Linux: `~/development/flutter`

3. Add Flutter to your system `PATH`:
   * Windows:
     * Search for "Environment Variables"
     * Edit Path and add: `C:\src\flutter\bin`

   * macOS/Linux (in .bashrc, .zshrc, etc.):

        ```bash
        export PATH="$PATH:$HOME/development/flutter/bin"
        ```

## üß™ Run Flutter Doctor

Open a terminal and run:

```bash
flutter doctor
```

This checks:
* Flutter installation
* Dart SDK
* Android SDK (if installed)
* Connected devices
* Required dependencies (like Xcode)

Follow the suggestions it gives to fix any issues.

## üß± Android SDK Setup

If you're not using Android Studio, you **must** install the Android SDK manually:

1. Download command line tools.
2. Set environment variables:

    ```bash
    export ANDROID_HOME=$HOME/Android/Sdk
    export PATH=$PATH:$ANDROID_HOME/emulator
    export PATH=$PATH:$ANDROID_HOME/tools
    export PATH=$PATH:$ANDROID_HOME/tools/bin
    export PATH=$PATH:$ANDROID_HOME/platform-tools
    ```

3. Accept licenses:

    ```bash
    yes | sdkmanager --licenses
    ```

üì¶ Or just [install Android Studio](https://developer.android.com/studio/install) and use its built-in *SDK Manager* and *AVD Manager* to set the same variables and accept the licenses.

## üë®‚Äçüíª Using VS Code for Flutter

1. Install VS Code: https://code.visualstudio.com
2. Install Extensions:
   * Open Extensions panel (Ctrl+Shift+X)
   * Install:
     * ``Flutter``
     * ``Dart``
3. Open your project:
   * Clone the repository from Git
   * In the terminal, open the folder of the repository `SemesterProjectSS25`
   * Then execute:
        ```sh
        cd semester_project
        ```
4. Select a device:
   * Connect a real device via USB with **USB debuggin enbaled** in the *Developer Settings*.
   * Create and launch an emulator in Android Studio
   * For easy access to the devices, access the command palette (`Ctrl+Shift+P`) and type "*Flutter: Select Device*" and click on the desired one (they only appear if they are connected).

5. Run the app:
   * Press F5, or
   * Use the terminal:

        ```sh
        flutter run     # in the semester_project directory
        ```
   * Right click on the `main.dart` file and choose `Run With/Without Debugging`.
   * In the `DEBUG CONSOLE` the loggs should show the building and launching process of the app, as well as app messages.

‚ö†Ô∏è Make sure the [server is running](server-setup) before launching the app, otherwise the device won't establish a connection.
